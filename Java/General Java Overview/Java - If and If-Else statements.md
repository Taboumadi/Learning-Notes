Just like with everything, the code is read from top to bottom, so be careful about the order in which you write your statements. This is called an "Else-if ladder"

# Nested If Statements
To handle more complex decision-making, you can nested if/else statements. But be careful, and always consider using a switch or polymorphism when applicable.
