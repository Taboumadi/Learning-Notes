Learning-Notes is a public repository for me to publish my notes concerning the attainment of Certifications, Credits Towards my SWE Degree, and any other Learning-Related activities that I will be partaking in.

It's Created in Markdown using Obsidian.md

This is an exercise for me to learn more about GitHub, and to give me an incentive to be active in my Education Journey.

Feel Free to provide feedback, comment, and use these notes as long as you abide by the License.

^^ Thank you

-Anthony
